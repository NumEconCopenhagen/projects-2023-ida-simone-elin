This repository contains  
1. **Inaugural project**: We consider a model for the time use of a household consisting of one male and one female working at home and at the labor market. The projects seeks to explore the relative hours worked at home given different relative wages and substitution elasticities. We extend the model with a reform of the labour market. 
2. **Data project**: We fetch data from OECD on life expectancy at age 65 and health risks and show that alcohol and smoking negatively impact life expectancy, while social support (friends and familiy) have a positive effect.
3. **Model project**: We model the Solow model with economic damages from climate change.
