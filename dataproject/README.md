# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Health risks and life expectancy** and investigates how daily smoking, social support and alcohol consumption affects life expectancy at 65 years old. To do so we run a fxied effects 0regression to determine the effects of each variable. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. alcohol.csv (*https://data.oecd.org/healthrisk/alcohol-consumption.htm#indicator-chart*) 
1. lifeexp65.csv (*https://data.oecd.org/healthstat/life-expectancy-at-65.htm#indicator-chart*)
1. smokers.csv (*https://data.oecd.org/healthrisk/daily-smokers.htm#indicator-chart*)
1. socsupport.csv (*https://data.oecd.org/healthrisk/social-support.htm#indicator-chart*)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install geopandas``
``pip install linearmodels``
